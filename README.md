## ðŸ™… Facilities and uses

To create and run Javascript programs, you need to download NodeJs.

NodeJs allows JavaScript code to be executed outside of a web browser.

To download NodeJs, just go to the download page by [clicking here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

If the page doesn't open, just search for "nodejs download" on Google and go to the official website.

Once on the download page, you can leave the LTS option selected and choose the platform: Windows, Linux or Mac.

To check if NodeJs was correctly installed, open your prompt command and type:

```
node -v
```

Along with the NodeJs installation comes npm (or Node Package Manager), which is the NodeJs package manager.

To check the npm version type:

```
npm -v
```

If everything goes well, the terminal will inform you of the version installed on your machine.

To run a javascript program outside of the browser, go to the folder where the file is and type in a terminal:

```
node nome_projeto.js
```

With this, your code will be executed and displayed in your terminal.
